        * Improve JTreeTester with check to see if component already selected, along with matching unit test

2012-01-28  Gerard Davison 
        * Check that the row was actually selected in JTreeTester, add unit test to make sure it fails properly
          in this case
        * Change the select/create reference key accelerator to a double tap on the CTRL key as it was getting
          increasingly hard to find an accelerator that works accross all windows managers / platforms.

2012-12-04  Gerard Davison 
        * Better waitForIdle failure characteristics
        * Comprehensive swing soak target
        * Fixed problem with JInternalFrameTesterTest when running multiple test reps

2012-11-28  Gerard Davison 
        * Catch infinite loop from SunToolkit.realSync
        * Increase timeout and allow some configuration

2012-11-27  Gerard Davison 
        * EDT violations in Focus code
        * EDT violations in tests
        * Use of SunToolkit.realSync to deal with intermittent failures and improved
          waitForIdle reliability
        * RawTestButtonTesterTest as test case for working with the JDK team.
        * Reducd SLEEP_INTERVAL back to a much lower value
        * If a FailedTest is a cause for another then the SystemState is copied over

2012-11-12  Gerard Davison
        * Interim checkin for test stability (To be revised as I work with the JDK team)
        * increase SLEEP_INTERVAL to 100 to reduce intermittent ButtonTest failures
        * ConditionalEDT wrapper now does toString on the event queue.

2012-11-07  Gerard Davison
        * ActionClick make sure component is enabeld before we try to click on it, with a wait
        * Some more waits to make JComboBox more reliable
        * Some more waits to make JList testing more reliable, include current workaround for missing selection
             bug where we retry if we miss the first time. 

2012-11-05  Gerard Davison
        * Renamed WaitTimedOutError -> WaitTimedOutException and made extend FailedException for better
          diagnostics
        * assert calls are now performed on the EDT thread if they are to a method of a Component subclass

2012-10-31  Gerard Davison
        * Improved diagnostics on JTree selection failure
        * Add support for customer renderers and lazy population of JComboBox

        * Fixed EDT violation in ComponentTree

2012-10-18  Minato Mamano
        * Resolve issue with Applet Viewer on non en machines.

2012-06-21  Gerard Davison
        * Modify the toggleRow funcition in JTreeTester to temporaily up the number of clicks for a toggle to
          5 so that we don't acidently trigger a double click listener.

2012-06-11  Gerard Davison
	* Provide better information for the user when we match multiple components to a single ComponentReference

2012-05-25  Gerard Davison
        * Resolve possible and actualy EDT violations in String Robot.getXXXXX methods as reported 
          with internal testing.

2012-05-18  Gerard Davison
        * Work to resolve a stack overflow when using Costello to record in Netbeans, which it turns out
          wasn't enough to make the fixes in 3495968. Basically getPopupMenu was causing all child
          components to be added and removed, so I have modified the code to use reflection first of
          all to get hold of the popupMenu field followed by getPopupMenu if it doesn't. This gives
          a snapshot of the current structure of the UI whcih I think is the intent of the code. Future
          work would be to put some kind of delay in for the ComponentTree to deal with a future packet
          storm.
        
2012-05-15  Gerard Davison
        * Added variable subsitution for the Launch step after user request

2012-05-12  Gerard Davison

        * Updated version number to 1.3.0RC1

        * Added very basic cut/copy/paste clipboard support, don't support references from another file yet
        * Added the ability to just delete a step
        * Bug 3524725, using the incorrect version of actionClick when parameter is a number not a string
           * sort methods so that we try to match boolean, primitives, Numbers, strings then any other object
        
        * RecordingFailedException, now uses standard cause property
        * ScriptEditorFrame, a coupld of EDT violations in normal operation
        * JTextComponentTester, unreliable selection on text that is not visible as drag doesn't happen when
            text is offset to the end of the text field. [Removed as doesn't quite work]
        * EDT violations in JTreeTester
        * EDT violation in JComboxBoxTester
        * EDT vioaltions in JTableTester
        
        * JDK 7 Fixes
          * StringsTest failed on JDK 7, looks like a difference in classloading, using different property names
            fixed the problems

          * AppClassLoaderTest, fixed tests to be more reliable under garbage collection

          * JTabbedPanelTester, not waiting for idle after tab click
          * JTableTesterTest, EDT vioaltion causing test to intermittently fail
          * WeakAWTEventListenerTest, gc code lead to unreliable test
          * ComponentReference, failures due to inability to access parent reference correct. (Not sure why this
              wasn't cauing a problem with JDK 6, should make things faster though)
          * Added support for more recent JDK versions in the Platform class
          
          
        TODO add tests for editor cut/copy/paste support
        

2012-04-26  Gerard Davison
        * Make the code in JTreeLocation EDT safe

2012-04-03  Gerard Davison
	* Show the user an error dialog if the script file contains erros
	* Rather than consume every key event make the CallStep editor wait for a little while
          and coalasing similar events so that we don't hit the class loader too much
        * Deal with an IllegalArgumentException when editing the class for an action step

2012-03-13  Gerard Davison

        * Minor fix in TestSelector for a null poiter when pressing "Select Test Suite...." button

          Netbean evaluate abbot for testing purposes.
        * Put in a fix to allow the menu code to try to re-open a menu if it fails the first time
          as we are having a rash of intermittent failures caused by this.
        * Make sure that makePathVisible on JTreeTester passes timeout to parent elements.

2012-02-27  Gerard Davison

        * Unreported issue where lazily populated to text field would sometime report an error in the
          scroll to visible method, instead we can now wait until such a time that the model is complete


2012-02-02  Gerard Davison

        * Better waiting when maximizing and selecting top level menu items.
        * Added JTextComponentTester.actionClick(comp,text) to make it easier to click on hyperlinks

        * 3476008 waitForIdle can time out with Java 1.7
        * Extra debug infromation for ActionFailedException, threads, focus and AWT Tree.

2011-12-19  Gerard Davison

	* build.xml: Fix broken copy of non-java resources.

2005-04-29  Timothy Wall  <twall@users.sf.net>

	* Use ASCII properties files and move them to the source tree.  A
	little more circuitous to edit, but makes them more accessible
	from Eclipse.

	The main thing I *don't* like about burying them in the source
	tree is that that makes them less accessible to someone who would
	like to edit them (the i18n dir at the top level is much more 
	appropriate in that case).  I generally dislike burying resources
	in with source code.

2005-03-24  Gary Johnston, Tom Roche  <{gjohnsto, tlroche}@users.sf.net>

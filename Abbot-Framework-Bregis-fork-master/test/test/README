NOTES on tests

Recorder tests:
Some window managers force a window to be activated when it is shown; this is
usually the result of a click-to-focus policy.  Other window managers with a
pointer-focus policy may not activate a window when it is shown.  Be sure to
account for this when checking for a recorded activate event.

Platform-specific issues:
If you encounter strange behavior that causes a test to fail, add code *for
your current platform only* to check for that strange behavior, and comment it
accordingly.
